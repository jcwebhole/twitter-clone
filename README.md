# A clone of modern twitter
Coded as a practice for making apps in Ruby on Rails. Most tutorials online tackles the old twitter interface - I chose to follow the current one (2017).
Just took some UI components, left others to almost basic. This is a work in progress.
Active app is viewable at https://twitter-clone-jasonbruno.c9users.io/

### Features
- Only viewable when logged in except user profile pages
- Reverse chronological order of tweets (top being the most current)
- Other user profiles can be browsed with filters to their own posts
- Own user profile can be edited to add an avatar/photo

### Usage
- Just like twitter - only more basic

### Languages/Technologies/Gems used
- Ruby on Rails (http://rubyonrails.org/)
- Devise (https://github.com/plataformatec/devise)
- active_link_to (https://github.com/comfy/active_link_to)
- Paperclip (https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip)
- Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com)
- Cloud9 IDE (https://c9.io/)
- Dillinger (http://dillinger.io)

### Roadmap
- Make it look more twitter-y
- Make URLs clickable in tweets (rails_autolink)
- Display image if an image is detected in the tweet text content
- Use paperclip to let users upload photos with their tweet
